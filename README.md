# Eat-Da-Burger

## Description 

* Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Me` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Once the burger has been eaten, it can be removed from the list to make way for more burgers
